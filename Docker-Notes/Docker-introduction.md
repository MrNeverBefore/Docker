# Docker

- Docker is a containerization tool that packages an application and all its dependencies into a single lightweight container that runs consistently anywhere.

- containerization is a concept or tech and Docker is the implementation of containerization.




## Advantages

-  Portable: Runs consistently across any environment.
- Lightweight: Uses fewer resources than virtual machines.
- Fast: Containers start in seconds.
- Consistent: Eliminates “works on my machine” issues.
- Easy deployment: Simplifies build, ship, and run workflows.
- Scalable: Supports rapid scaling of applications.
- Isolated: Separates apps for security and stability.
- Flexible: Works on Linux, Windows, macOS, and cloud.
- Version controlled: Images can be versioned and rolled back.
- Supports microservices: Enables modular app architectures.




## Disadvantages of Docker

- Security Risks: Containers share the host OS kernel, so a breach can affect multiple containers.

- Persistent Storage Complexity: Managing data persistence outside containers can be challenging.
 - Difficult to manage large no of containers.
 - Auto Healing no there.
- No Auto Scaling and its not sutaible for Enterprise level.
